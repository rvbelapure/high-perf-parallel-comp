Part 1 : The objective was to convert Cilk plus implementation of quicksort
	 to OpenMP. As Cilk and openMP have similar programming model, it was
	 sufficient to convert _Cilk_spawn calls to omp tasks and the _Cilk_for
	 statements to omp for's.

Part 2 : Parallel mergesort algorithm in Chapter 27 of Cormen, Leiserson, 
	 Rivest, and Stein was implemented for parallel mergesort implementation
	 in OpenMP.
	 The algorithm has iherent parallelism in the recursive mergesort 
	 routine. The merging phase after the sorting was also parallelized using
	 divide and conquor strategy.

	 The performance of approximately 18-20 Million keys per second was 
	 achieved against serial performance of approx 5 Million keys per sec.
