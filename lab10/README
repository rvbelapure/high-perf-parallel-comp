Part 1 : Optimization of PageRank Iteration
---------------------------------------------

We make following observation regarding the naive version of the function that
is called on each iteration of the page rank algorithm :

The effect of link-free pages on transition probability for a page is only a 
function of previous probabilities and it does not depend any quantity that
varies per page. Thus, this value can be calculated only once and then it 
can added to the transition probabilities of individual pages. Thus, we move
the loop calculating this value outside the loop that iterates over pages and
then initialize the transition_probability with this value instead at the 
beginning of each iteration over every page.

This gives us performance of approximately 6050 IPS, which is ~400x speedup.
