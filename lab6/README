In Part 1, we increased the number of computations per thread to hide the
latency. This way, the performance was boosted from 72 GFLOPS to 475 GFLOPS.

In Part 2, we continue with this optimizations. We divide the block in two 
dimensions, instead of only in 1 dimension. We also increase our tile size
to 64x64 to incorporate more work for the block. We reduce the number of threads
in the block so that a block of 16x16 threads work on a tile of size 64x64.
This allowed us to reach the performance of approx. 560 GFLOPS.
